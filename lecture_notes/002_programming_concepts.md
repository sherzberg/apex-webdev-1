# Programming Concepts

### Goals

* Understand basic programming concepts
* Build simple computer programs
* Understand basic PHP syntax

### Exercises

The assessment this week will be to build a library of functions that
will aid in Geometry calculations. For example, we will have some code
that will be able to calculate the area of a circle.

## Execution

There are two main types of programs we will be running:

* Short running scripts
* Long running applications/services

All programs have both inputs and outputs. Inputs are used to change the
the execution and output of the running program. Outputs can be used to show
results or to be inputs to another program.

Create a file called `intro.php` and enter this as its contents:

```php
<?php

echo "Hello!";
?>
```

Now we can execute the script like this:

```bash
$ php intro.php
```

The php script was read in by the php interpreter and executed line by line.
Our `Hello!` should be displayed as output.

## Variables

Variables are used like lookup keys in a table of contents. They are references
to things in the program.

Variable syntax in PHP looks like this:

```php
$x = 5;

$thisIsMyVariable = 99;

$anotherVariable = "value";
```

## Data Types and Operators/Methods/Functions

Data Types are the classification and rules that apply to data.

For example, an `integer` type supports the classification of numeric whole
numbers. You can add, subtract, divide, and multiply integers.

There are many different Types and you can even create your own!

Here are some very common types we will use:

* Strings
* Integers
* Floating point numbers
* Arrays

Operators/methods/functions are the "things" you do to/with types. For another math
example, the `+` operator says you should add two numbers together.

## Logic Operators

## Iteration

## Functions
